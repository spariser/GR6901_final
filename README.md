## Research the relationship between high temperature anomalies and state-aggregate construction and all-industry GDP

This project will look at the relationship between maximum daily temperature and gross domestic product. This project specifically looks to see if anomalies in temperature affect GDP overall and in particular construction GDP, a sector at high risk of heat related issues. For both GDP, this project will analyze seasonally adjusted GDP aggregated by state.

The project will use global daily gridded temperature data from [NOAA](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cpc.globaltemp.html) and quarterly all industry and construction Gross Domestic Product aggregated by state and seasonally adjusted from [the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=construction%3Bgdp%3Bstate&et=&pageID=2).

Temperature anomalies will be calculated versus longer term trends (30 years) and aggregated quarterly to match GDP data. The project will focus on the period between Q1 2018 and Q2 2024, as this represents the periods with data available from the Federal Reserve Bank.
